# PacBio_Pipelines
Repository for working pacbio pipelines in Sequencing Facility

Working pipelines will be added to this folder.

1. PacBio Sequencing,  IsoSeq (aka. RNASeq)
Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing and Iso-Seq analysis allow you to generate full-length cDNA sequences — no assembly required — to characterize transcript isoforms within targeted genes or across an entire transcriptome so that you can easily and affordably:
Discover new genes, transcripts and alternative splicing events
Improve genome annotation to identify gene structure, regulatory elements,and coding regions
Increase the accuracy of RNA-seq quantification with isoform-level resolution
